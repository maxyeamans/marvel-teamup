# [Marvel Teamup](https://maxyeamans.github.io/soaring-indigo-mimes/)

## What it is
This app was a group project that allows you to select two Marvel characters and find out when they first appeared in comics together. If you want to purchase a bit of that comic history, the app presents eBay auction results for the first comic appearances and some really expensive auctions related to the characters.

# How it works
Click two of the characters that you want to see when they first appeared in comics together, then click the Team Up button at the bottom. If the characters have appeared together, the first three appearances will display. Not the teamup you wanted? Click the Select New Team Up button to start over.

Once you have teamup results, you'll see some eBay auctions for the comics that your two chosen characters first appeared in. For the big spenders, there are also auction results for the most expensive items related to those characters.

## What we used
* Marvel API: get comic information and images for characters
* eBay API: get auction results for comics and characters
* Firebase: database to house character information and make API calls easier
* Velocity.js: sick animations to transition between choosing and viewing a teamup
* jQuery: DOM manipulation and AJAX requests to APIs
* Bootstrap: layout and design
